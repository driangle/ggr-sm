# ggr-sm : A simple lightweight state machine in Scala

This package contains a simple and lightweight library for implementing state machines in Scala.
The library allows the client to user their own state, input types and transition functions.

Currently only one implementation of the StateMachine interface exists:
- `StateMachine.WithFunctionTransitions[State, Input]`: allows clients to specify transitions of type `PartialFunction[(State, Input), State]`. 
   If the transition is not defined for a (State, Input) then the StateMachine will remain in its current state.

## Usage


#### Define a StateMachine

```scala
import ggr.sm.StateMachine

val sm = StateMachine.WithFunctionTransitions[String, String]()
      .initialState("Inactive")
      .transition({
        case ("Inactive", "Begin") => "Active"
        case ("Inactive", "Exit") => "Exit"
        case ("Active", "End") => "Inactive"
        case ("Active", "Pause") => "Paused"
        case ("Paused", "Resume") => "Active"
        case ("Paused", "End") => "Inactive"
      })
      .build()
```
#### Use a StateMachine

```scala

// currentState: gets the current state of the StateMachine
val state = sm.currentState 

// consume(input) : causes the StateMachine to consume an input and advance to the next state according to its transition function
val nextState = sm.consume("Begin") 

// peek(input): allows a client to peek at the next state if the StateMachine were to consume the given input.
val potentialNextState = sm.peek("Pause")

// reset() : allows client to reset StateMachine back to its initial state
val initialState = sm.reset()

// set(state) : allows client to forcefully change the state of teh StateMachine
sm.set("CustomState")
```

### More advanced example
```scala
import ggr.sm.StateMachine
case class UIState(clicks : Seq[Point])

sealed trait UserEvent
case class MousePressed(mouse : Point)
case class KeyPressed(key : Char)

val sm = StateMachine.WithFunctionTransitions[UIState, UserEvent]()
      .initialState(UIState())
      .transition({
        // when Mouse is pressed, then add location to list of clicks
        case (state, MousePressed(mouse)) => state.copy(clicks = state.clicks :+ mouse)
        // when key 'c' is pressed then clear the mouse clicks
        case (state, KeyPressed(key)) if key == 'c' => state.copy(clicks = List.empty)
      })
      .build()
```
